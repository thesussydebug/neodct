# SIM7600G Modem Bring-Up (0.3.0a)

How NeoDCT talks to the SIM7600G-H on T-Mobile, from raw AT pokes to live
signal bars on the home screen. No ModemManager, no libqmi, no PPP — the
whole stack is BusyBox + the kernel's `option` and `qmi_wwan` drivers +
~400 lines of Python.

## The stack

| Layer | Piece | Job |
|-------|-------|-----|
| kernel | `option` driver | `1e0e:9001` is in its device table (SIM7100/7600 entry) → auto-binds, creates `/dev/ttyUSB0-4` |
| kernel | `qmi_wwan` + `usb_wdm` | `wwan0` network interface at the stock PID, no mode-switching |
| shell | `/NeoDCT/System/engineering/tools/atcmd` | one scriptable AT command per call, lock-safe |
| boot | `/etc/init.d/S45modem` | backgrounded auto-connect: SIM → register → `AT$QCRMCALL` → SLAAC |
| UI | `System/core/ModemService` | owns the AT port from Python; CSQ → home-screen bars, call control, URC events |

Port map at the stock PID `1e0e:9001`:

| Node | Interface | Purpose |
|------|-----------|---------|
| `/dev/ttyUSB0` | 0 | Qualcomm DIAG (binary — leave it alone) |
| `/dev/ttyUSB1` | 1 | GPS NMEA stream |
| `/dev/ttyUSB2` | 2 | **AT commands** ← everything here uses this |
| `/dev/ttyUSB3` | 3 | AT / PPP modem port (spare) |
| `/dev/ttyUSB4` | 4 | **call audio PCM** (16 kHz mono S16_LE after `AT+CPCMREG=1`) |

## QEMU passthrough recap

```
-device qemu-xhci,id=xhci
-device usb-host,bus=xhci.0,vendorid=0x1e0e,productid=0x9001
```

* `chmod 666 /dev/bus/usb/BBB/DDD` on the host (avoids running QEMU as
  root, which breaks PulseAudio).
* **Stop ModemManager on the host first** (`systemctl stop ModemManager`):
  it grabs the AT ports the moment the modem enumerates and QEMU may
  detach the device mid-conversation, leaving the firmware confused.
* **Never `AT+CUSBPIDSWITCH`** while using QEMU passthrough: the modem
  re-enumerates with a new product ID and the `productid=0x9001` filter
  stops matching, so the modem vanishes from the guest. (Also the reason
  we use `$QCRMCALL` instead of RNDIS mode.)
* Hardware note: until the blown CapXon cap is bodged (470–1000 µF ≥6.3 V
  across 5 V/GND), expect possible brownout reboots during LTE TX bursts.
  A mid-session reboot looks like all `ttyUSB*` nodes vanishing and
  re-enumerating — `dmesg` will show the disconnect.

## Stage 1 — terminal proof of concept

`atcmd` ships in the image at `/NeoDCT/System/engineering/tools/atcmd`.
Sanity checks first:

```sh
alias at='/NeoDCT/System/engineering/tools/atcmd'
at AT              # -> OK              (modem alive)
at ATI             # -> SIM7600 model info
at AT+CPIN?        # -> +CPIN: READY    (SIM detected/unlocked)
at AT+CSQ          # -> +CSQ: 20,99     (rssi 0-31; 99,99 = no signal yet)
at AT+CEREG?       # -> +CEREG: 0,1     (…,1 home / …,5 roaming = registered)
at AT+COPS?        # -> +COPS: 0,0,"T-Mobile",7
```

Then the data call (T-Mobile is IPv6-only with NAT64/DNS64). APN matters:
our Tello SIM uses **`wholesale`**; a native T-Mobile SIM wants
`fast.t-mobile.com` (S45modem walks both automatically, see Stage 2):

```sh
at 'AT+CGDCONT=1,"IPV6","wholesale"'
at -t 15 'AT$QCRMCALL=1,1'          # firmware starts the RmNet call
ip link set wwan0 up
sysctl -w net.ipv6.conf.wwan0.accept_ra=2
sleep 5                              # SLAAC: address arrives via RA
ip -6 addr show dev wwan0            # want a "scope global" inet6 here
ping -6 -c 3 2606:4700:4700::1111    # packets over a REAL TOWER
```

DNS for name resolution (Google DNS64, synthesizes AAAA for v4-only hosts):

```sh
echo 'nameserver 2001:4860:4860::6464' >> /etc/resolv.conf
```

Useful extras: `AT+CGPADDR=1` (modem's view of the address),
`AT+CGCONTRDP=1` (address + T-Mobile's own DNS servers),
`AT$QCRMCALL?` (call state), `AT$QCRMCALL=0,1` (tear down).

## Stage 2 — automatic connection at boot

`/etc/init.d/S45modem` runs the whole Stage-1 sequence in the background
at every boot (boot itself never blocks): waits for the AT port, checks
the SIM, waits up to 90 s for LTE registration, then dials and brings up
`wwan0`. The bring-up is self-healing:

* **ESM settle** — waits 8 s after `+CEREG: 0,1` before dialing.
  Dialing instantly gets `+CEER: ESM sync up with network` rejects
  while the attach (including the IMS PDN that carries VoLTE) is still
  being set up.
* **Ride the attach bearer first** — each round starts with `AT+CGACT?`;
  if the network already activated a non-IMS context (seen live as
  `+CGACT: 2,1`), `$QCRMCALL` starts on *that* cid without redefining
  anything — the network can reject a second PDN request while happily
  serving the first.
* **APN walk** — the cached winner, the modem's own cid1 definition
  (whatever ModemManager last connected with), `wholesale` (Tello —
  confirmed against the host's working NetworkManager profile), then
  `fast.t-mobile.com` and `tello.com`.
* **PDP-type walk** — each APN is tried as `IPV6`, then `IPV4V6` (the
  host's proven ModemManager bearer was ipv4v6; some plans reject
  v6-only contexts with an instant `NO CARRIER`).
* **NO CARRIER = try again** — weak RF (the basement) rejects calls
  that succeed moments later. Every dial retries once, the whole walk
  runs `MODEM_DIAL_ROUNDS` (4) times with a PS re-attach between rounds
  (`AT+CGATT=0/1` — also required for a rewritten cid1 to take effect),
  and after that the worker idles and redials forever every
  `MODEM_REDIAL_IDLE_S` (120 s), like the phone app does. Every
  rejection logs `AT+CEER` (the network's actual reject cause) and
  `AT+CPSI?` (real RSRP, far more honest than CSQ indoors).
* **Automatic raw-ip** — if the call is up but no SLAAC address arrives
  in 20 s, qmi_wwan framing is flipped to raw-ip and the call re-dialed
  (many SIM7600 firmwares only speak raw-ip; no manual toggle needed).
* **QMI fallback (uqmi)** — each round ends with
  `uqmi --start-network --apn wholesale` on `/dev/cdc-wdm0` — the exact
  mechanism ModemManager used for the proven host connection, in case
  `$QCRMCALL` is the broken layer.
* **Module reset once** — if a whole dial cycle fails, `AT+CFUN=1,1`
  reboots the module and everything is retried. Firmware state survives
  USB passthrough: a QMI/WDS session left by host-side ModemManager can
  make every `$QCRMCALL` fail instantly with a stale
  `+CEER: EMM detached` even though CEREG shows registered and bearers
  are active. `MODEM_RESET_ON_FAIL=n` disables it.
* **Carrier DNS** — `AT+CGCONTRDP` (in `AT+CGPIAF` colon notation) puts
  T-Mobile's own DNS64 servers into resolv.conf first; the Google DNS64
  anycast stays as fallback.
* **Success cache** — the APN + framing that worked land in
  `/etc/modem.cache`, so the next boot connects on the first try.
  Delete the file to re-probe from scratch.

* Watch it work: `tail -f /tmp/modem-boot.log`
* One-word answer: `cat /tmp/modem.status` → `up:wwan0` / `failed: …`
* Re-run by hand: `/etc/init.d/S45modem restart`

Overrides live in `/etc/default/modem` (plain sh, all optional):

```sh
MODEM_APN="wholesale"        # first configured APN (Tello data APN)
MODEM_APN_FALLBACKS="fast.t-mobile.com tello.com"
MODEM_PDPTYPE="IPV6"         # preferred context type
MODEM_PDPTYPE_FALLBACKS="IPV4V6"
MODEM_PORT="/dev/ttyUSB2"
MODEM_RAW_IP="auto"          # auto-detected; "y"/"n" to pin the framing
MODEM_DIAL_ROUNDS=4          # APN-walk rounds before going to slow retry
MODEM_DIAL_RETRY_WAIT_S=15   # pause between rounds
MODEM_REDIAL_IDLE_S=120      # forever-retry cadence after the rounds
```

## Stage 3 — the software (ModemService)

`System/core/ModemService` now drives the real modem (same
probe-or-simulate pattern as BatteryService):

* **Live signal bars**: polls `AT+CSQ` every 5 s; the home-screen `sig`
  icon_set renders 0–4 real bars (not registered → 0 bars). In QEMU
  without passthrough it stays on the layout's `sim_val`.
* **Port auto-probe**: prefers USB interface 2, then 3 (read from sysfs),
  confirms with `AT`→`OK`; re-probes every 10 s if the modem is missing,
  so passthrough/hotplug attach after boot is adopted automatically.
* **Live carrier line**: the home screen's "No Service" text becomes the
  real operator name ("Tello" / "T-Mobile", short-format `AT+COPS=3,1`)
  once registered; it falls back to "No Service" whenever registration
  drops.
* **Calls are LIVE and FULL-DUPLEX**: `system.modem.allow_calls`
  defaults ON (OFF restores the pretend flow). `dial()` sends `ATD`,
  then immediately `AT+CPCMREG=1`, then runs two alsa-utils pipes on the
  bidirectional PCM port: `aplay -t raw -f S16_LE -r 16000 -c 1
  /dev/ttyUSBn` (downlink → speaker) and `arecord … -D <mic> /dev/ttyUSBn`
  (USB sound card mic → uplink). Mic device:
  `system.hw.modem_mic_device` ("default"; `plughw:N,0` to pin;
  OFF = listen-only; three arecord failures auto-degrade to listen-only
  — check `arecord -l` and capture levels with `amixer`). Teardown
  (End key, `NO CARRIER`, `VOICE CALL: END`) kills both pipes and sends
  `AT+CPCMREG=0`; the call screen exits by itself on remote hangup.
  Typing a number plays fake DTMF beeps (`System/tones/dtmf/`). Test
  line: 1-800-444-4444 (MCI readback — it reads your voice channel back,
  so hearing your own mic echo confirms full duplex!). QEMU note: if
  `arecord -l` in the guest is empty, QEMU's usb-audio is playback-only
  on your build — use `-device virtio-sound-pci,audiodev=audio0`
  instead/alongside (kernel already has `CONFIG_SND_VIRTIO=y`).
  Bench note: LTE TX during a call is the worst case for the missing
  capacitor — if the modem vanishes mid-call, that's the brownout.
* **Coexistence**: every port transaction takes the advisory lock
  `/tmp/neodct-modem.lock`, shared with `atcmd` and `S45modem` — you can
  poke AT commands from the serial console while the UI runs.
* **Sim hooks** (QEMU, no modem): `echo 23 > /tmp/neodct_sim_csq` drives
  the bars; `echo 5551234 > /tmp/neodct_sim_ring` fakes an incoming call
  (`rm` it to "hang up"); `echo Tello > /tmp/neodct_sim_operator` fakes
  the carrier line; dialing auto-"connects" after 2 s.
* **SMS sending is LIVE** (the first real telephony): Messages → Write
  Message → Options → Send prompts for a number (arrow keys open the
  PhoneBook contact picker) and sends via `ModemService.send_sms()` —
  text-mode `AT+CMGS` with special handling for the newline-less `>`
  prompt.
* **SMS receiving is LIVE, 3310-style** (NotifyService): `AT+CNMI`
  pushes `+CMTI` the instant a message lands → fetched with `AT+CMGR`,
  deleted from the SIM, stored in the inbox DB. The original Nokia tone
  beeps immediately; the home screen shows "N message(s) received" with
  the **Read** softkey (C dismisses) and a flashing envelope while
  unread mail exists. A boot sweep (`AT+CMGL="REC UNREAD"`) imports
  messages that arrived while the phone was off. QEMU sim hook:
  `echo '5551234|hey' > /tmp/neodct_sim_sms`.
* **Incoming calls ring and interrupt apps**: `RING`/`+CLIP` →
  `IncomingCall` (a `BaseException`, like `KeyboardInterrupt`) raised
  from `read_keypress` unwinds whatever app is running (their `finally`
  blocks release ALSA), then the 3310-style screen shows the caller with
  a flashing "calling", **Answer** softkey and **C** to decline. The
  ringtone is `system.audio.ringtone`, looped in-process via miniaudio.
  QEMU sim hook: `echo 16165551234 > /tmp/neodct_sim_ring` rings once
  per write/touch; `rm` it to make the caller give up.
* **Modem engineering app** (menu id 9005): RADIO / SIM / DATA status
  pages, softkey walks Next→Next→Exit. Shows operator, CEREG, CSQ+dBm,
  CPIN, phone number, IMEI, ICCID, IMSI, firmware, S45modem status, wwan
  interface, IPv6, APN and DNS — troubleshooting without a serial
  console. In Simulation Mode it lists which ttyUSB nodes exist instead
  of bailing out.

## Stage 4 — proving the full stack (modem = the internet)

`scripts/qemu_modem_data_test.py` is the one-command end-to-end proof.
It boots the image headless (`-snapshot`, so rootfs.ext4 is untouched)
with the modem passed through, logs in over the serial socket, waits for
S45modem's verdict, then checks: wwan0 global IPv6, default route,
ping to a real v6 literal, DNS resolution, HTTP fetch, HTTPS fetch (the
exact path NetSurf uses — libcurl + the target CA bundle).

```sh
# host, from neodct/: close any other QEMU using the modem first
scripts/qemu_modem_data_test.py            # → RESULT: PASS/FAIL + boot log
```

Manual equivalent inside any running guest (serial console):

```sh
/etc/init.d/S45modem restart
sleep 60; cat /tmp/modem.status; tail -30 /tmp/modem-boot.log
ping -6 -c 2 2606:4700:4700::1111    # image ≥ this commit; else use curl
curl -sI https://example.com          # DNS64 + NAT64 + TLS, full browser path
```

Once `modem.status` says `up:wwan0`, NetSurf needs nothing special: it
resolves via resolv.conf (DNS64 synthesizes AAAA for v4-only sites) and
routes over wwan0's SLAAC default route. In a QEMU that *also* has
usernet `eth0`, IPv6 wins by address-sort, so traffic still prefers the
modem — unplug eth0 (or boot the modem-only QEMU command) to be sure.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Meaning / fix |
|---------|---------------|
| no `/dev/ttyUSB*` | `lsusb` shows `1e0e:9001`? If yes: kernel missing `option` driver (needs the 0.3.0a image). If no: passthrough/cable/power. |
| interface isn't called `wwan0` | Normal — eudev predictable naming renames it (QEMU: `wwp0s5u3i5`). S45modem and the Modem app find it by the `qmi_wwan` driver, not the name; substitute your name in any manual command here. |
| `+CSQ: 99,99` forever | No RF: antenna, or modem brownout-rebooted (cap bodge). |
| `+CEREG: 0,2` stuck | Searching. Check antenna + `AT+CPIN?`; give it 1–2 min. |
| `+CEREG: 0,3` | Registration denied — APN/SIM plan issue usually. |
| `$QCRMCALL` OK but no SLAAC address | S45modem now flips raw-ip framing by itself; if hand-testing: `ip link set wwan0 down; echo Y > /sys/class/net/wwan0/qmi/raw_ip; ip link set wwan0 up` and re-dial. |
| `$QCRMCALL` → `NO CARRIER` instantly | Read the `cause:` (AT+CEER) lines in `/tmp/modem-boot.log`. "ESM sync up with network" = dialed too soon / second-PDN collision — the ride-the-attach-bearer path and settle delay handle it. "EMM detached" while CEREG=1 and `cgact:` shows active bearers = stale firmware state (usually host ModemManager's leftover QMI session) — the automatic `AT+CFUN=1,1` reset clears it. Cause #33 "service option not subscribed" = APN/plan. RF causes clear on retry — the worker keeps redialing every 2 min on its own. Check `cell:` (CPSI): field 12 is RSRP×10 (−1134 = −113.4 dBm; below ≈ −115 is cell-edge), field 11 RSRQ×10 (−185 = −18.5 dB, poor). |
| `$QCRMCALL` broken no matter what | The QMI path is the escape hatch (it's what ModemManager uses): `uqmi -d /dev/cdc-wdm0 --start-network --apn wholesale --ip-family ipv6`, then watch for SLAAC. S45modem tries this automatically at the end of every round. |
| every APN fails (`no data call yet`) | Wrong APN for the SIM (Tello = `wholesale`) or the plan has no data. Check `/tmp/modem-boot.log` for which were tried; delete `/etc/modem.cache` after changing plans. The proven-good APN is whatever the host's NetworkManager profile used: `nmcli -g gsm.apn connection show <name>`. |
| ping works, names don't | resolv.conf lacks a DNS64 server (Stage 1 step). |
| `ping -6` says invalid option | Image older than the busybox `PING6` fragment — use `curl -g 'http://[2606:4700:4700::1111]/'` instead. |
| `atcmd: modem port busy` | S45modem mid-registration or UI polling — it clears in seconds. |
| everything vanished mid-test | Modem rebooted (power) or host re-grabbed it (ModemManager). |
